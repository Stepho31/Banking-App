# VeryableCodingChallenge

# Key Features

• The purpose of this exercise is to build an app where the user can see the list of their banking and card accounts (AccountList) and select an individual account to view some details (AccountDetail).

• In order to get the list of accounts, you should make an HTTP request to retrieve this JSON file hosted on S3. The application should parse the response to the appropriate model and display in order.

• The list of accounts should be vertically scrollable. When a user touches one of the list items, the app should navigate to the next page (AccountDetail) where the user can see the details.

• To get back to AccountList from AccountDetail, the user can touch either the Done button or the back arrow in the navigation bar.
